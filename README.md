# Spring React Week #4

First of all, I would like to thank Mr. Prof. Doctor Nélio Alves from [DevSuperior - Escola de programação](https://devsuperior.com.br) for his classes on FullStack Web Developer.

This repository contains a web project that shows a list of sellers and their sales. The project is divided into two parts: backend and frontend. The languages used in this project are Java (Spring Framework) and JavaScript (React.js).
